# Self-Driving-Car-Simulation-Using-Neural-Networks-and-Machine-Learning

- Employs realistic physics concepts such as friction and acceleration to move the car.
- Collision sensors are designed using the intersection formula and take the point closest to the car.
- Once the car detects collision, the car stops moving and a new car is formed.
- The program also simulates traffic on the road. 
  - The car's sensors can read the traffic.
  - if the car collides with the traffic, the car stops and a new car is created.
