# JavaScript Neural Network Visualization

This project is an advanced JavaScript-based neural network visualization tool. It enables users to visualize neural networks and their behavior using HTML5 canvas. The tool includes comprehensive functions for creating, rendering, and analyzing neural networks. This README.md provides an in-depth guide to the project, its architecture, usage, and code quality, along with an explanation of how the neural network works internally.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following:

- A modern web browser that fully supports HTML5 canvas.
- Fundamental knowledge of JavaScript, including ES6 features, and HTML5.

## Installation

You can include the `neural-network-visualizer.js` script in your HTML file as follows:

```html
<script src="neural-network-visualizer.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Creating a Neural Network

To create a neural network, initialize a `NeuralNetwork` instance by specifying an array of layer sizes.

```javascript
const network = new NeuralNetwork([3, 4, 4, 2]);
```

### Rendering the Neural Network

To render the neural network, you'll need an HTML5 canvas element in your HTML file:

```html
<canvas id="network-canvas" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
```

```javascript
// Get the canvas context and create a NeuralNetworkRenderer instance.
const canvas = document.getElementById('network-canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const renderer = new NeuralNetworkRenderer(ctx);

// Render the neural network.
renderer.drawNetwork(network);
```

### Customization and Interactivity

The tool provides extensive customization options. You can modify node colors, connection weights, labels, and other visual aspects. It also supports interactive features like node highlighting and layer collapsing for detailed analysis.

## How the Neural Network Works

Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, and this visualization tool provides insights into their inner workings.

- **Input Layer**: The first layer represents the input features of your data.
  
- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers are known as hidden layers. Each node in a hidden layer computes a weighted sum of inputs and applies an activation function.
  
- **Output Layer**: The final layer produces the network's output, which can vary based on the problem (e.g., classification or regression).
  
- **Activation Functions**: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network. Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.

- **Weights and Biases**: The connections between nodes have associated weights, and each node has an associated bias. These parameters are adjusted during training to make accurate predictions.

- **Forward Propagation**: During inference, data flows through the network via forward propagation. Each node computes its output based on the weighted sum of inputs and the activation function.

- **Backpropagation**: During training, errors are calculated, and the network's parameters (weights and biases) are updated using backpropagation and optimization techniques like gradient descent.

Understanding these concepts is essential for interpreting the visualizations provided by this tool.

## API Reference

### `NeuralNetwork`

#### `constructor(layers: number[])`

- Initializes a new neural network with the specified layer architecture.

### `NeuralNetworkRenderer`

#### `constructor(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D)`

- Initializes a new renderer for drawing neural networks on an HTML5 canvas context.

#### `drawNetwork(network: NeuralNetwork, options?: NetworkRenderOptions)`

- Renders the specified neural network on the canvas.

### `NetworkRenderOptions` (optional)

- An object specifying rendering options for the neural network. These options include node colors, connection colors, labels, and more.

## Examples

## Code Review

This project follows best practices and maintains high code quality. Here's a brief code review:

- **Modularity**: The codebase is organized into reusable modules for neural network logic and rendering, promoting maintainability.

- **Documentation**: Functions, classes, and modules are well-documented using JSDoc comments, ensuring clarity for future contributors.

- **ES6 Features**: The code leverages modern JavaScript features like classes, arrow functions, and template literals for clean and readable code.

- **Customization**: The tool offers comprehensive customization options via a clear and extendable API, allowing users to tailor visualizations to their needs.

- **Performance**: Rendering is optimized for efficiency, ensuring smooth performance even with large networks.
